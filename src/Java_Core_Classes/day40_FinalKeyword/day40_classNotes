Package name: day40_FinalKeyword

Encapsulation:  data hiding
                give private access modifier to fields
                generate public getter/setters to read/write the private fields

                using the data:
                        reading the data
                        writing the data

Inheritance:    Is A relation.
                parent & child classes ( super & sub)
                class A  extends Class B

                child class (sub): inherits the variables and methods (Visible to the child class) from parent class (super)
                parent class (super): can not inherit anything from child (sub class)

protected access modifier:  Always visible within the same package
                            Visible outside the package in subclass ONLY



Final Keyword:  - Unchangeable
                - can be applied to variables, methods and classes
                - once a class is declared as final, you do not need to declare methods or variables in that class as final
                - all methods in java can be overloaded, final is not a obstacle to overload a method
                - final methods can not be overridden
                - final classes can not be inherited
                - overloading happens in the same class
                - overriding happens in the sub class
                - variables become constant, only once initialized
                - a final instance method can be called through the object
                - final classes are immutable

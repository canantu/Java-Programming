    MorningWorkOut:
        1. Do 30 push-ups and try pausing 1.5 seconds in each

Exception Handling:
        1. try & catch: used for handling checked & unchecked exceptions
                try{
                    exception code
                }catch(ExceptionType e){
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }

        2. throws:  - used for handling checked exceptions ONLY (temporary solution
                    - fastest way to get rid of checked exception (less code, clean code)
                    - Caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception
                    - in custom methods, it is better to use try-catch method
                    - in main method, it is ok to use throws keyword since it is not callable

throw keyword: used for manually throw exception
                throw ExceptionObject

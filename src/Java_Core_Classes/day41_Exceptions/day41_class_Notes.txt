Package name: day41_Exceptions

Access Modifiers:
        public > protected > default > private

Final Keyword:  unchangeable
                Variables: can not be reassigned
                Methods: can not be overridden
                Classes: can not be inherited (can not be parent class)

Exceptions Topic:
        1. Unchecked vs Checked
        2. try & catch blocks
        3. Multi-catch block
        4. finally block
        5. throws keyword

        7. Custom Exception


OutOfMemoryError: heap memory is full


Exceptions: unexpected or unwanted events
            Unchecked (unexpected event):
                    - occurs during the runtime
                    - all the RuntimeExceptions are unchecked exceptions

            Checked (unwanted event):
                    - occurs during the compile time
                    - all the exceptions that are not RuntimeExceptions are checked exception

Exception Handling:

1. Try & Catch blocks: used for handling checked and unchecked exceptions
            try{
                exception code
            }catch(ExceptionClass  e){
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

2. Multi-catch block:   - parent exception type can not be placed before the child exception type
                        - if handled by the first exception, remaining catch blocks will never be executed

3. finally block:   - always gets executed regardless of the exception is being handled or not handled
                    - to stop the execution of the "finally block": System.exit(0)


Interview Question:
        - final vs finally vs finalize

        - final is used with variables, methods and classes to make them unchangeable

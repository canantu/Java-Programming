1. Write a program that can return the first unique elements from an arraylist
    * Do not use indexOf & lastIndexOf methods

2. Write a program that can find the maximum, minimum and average number from an arrayList of integers

Bulk Operations: argument MUST be a collection type
    addAll(CollectionType): adds collection of values to the arrayList
    removeAll(CollectionType): removes all the matching elements (of collection type) from the arrayList
    retainAll(CollectionType): retains all the matching elements (of collection type) from the arrayList
    containsAll(CollectionType): checks multiple values if they exist in the arraylist

Arrays:
    asList(array of values) ===> returns the arrays as a collection type

Remove Functions:
    remove(): when we remove one element. DO NOt use it in the loop
    removeAll(): when we remove multiple elements (if we know what elements to remove)
    retainAll(): when we want to retain/keep multiple elements (if we know what elements to retain/keep)
    removeIf(): when we remove the elements based on a condition (if we don't know which elements to remove)

Collections : utility class of collection
    sort(): sorts the collections in ascending order
    reverse(): reverses the collection
    swap(): swap the elements of two indexes
    max(): returns the max element
    min(): returns the min element
    replaceAll():
    frequency():

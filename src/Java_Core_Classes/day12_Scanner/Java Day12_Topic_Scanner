Scanner Class: used for getting user inputs
                needs to be imported from "java.util"
                syntax of import statement:  import package.class;
                                            import java.util.Scanner;

                 Declare:
                 Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
                # whenever we use an object, we have to assign it to a variable, to make it reusable.
                # if we create an object everytime, it consumes memory.

                next() : only one word, until a space
                nextLine(): it reads until a new line

                if we use another method after nextLine method, it will ignore enter key, therefore we have to
                clear the memory of scanner. so we add one more nextLine() method
                # Example : nextInt() : when we enter 24 and push ENTER key, the method will only read 24 and ignore ENTER.
                it remains in the scanner's memory.

                ## If we use nextLine() after other method,

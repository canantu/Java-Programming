- STLC - Test Closure Step


1. Test strategy document
2. Test plan document
3. Test case document: QA, scenario, env, steps, test data, expected result,
                        actual result, test result: fail / pass, evidence: screenshot or videos

4. Environment Setup:
5. Test Execution: expected result vs actual result
                    if expected =! actual : bug life cycle starts
                    1- confirm it is a valid bug?
                        - test with multiple data
                        - test multiple QA environments
                        - ask other QA to check
                        - dev can help to confirm
                    2- Bug report doc -> assign, opened, fixed / deferred / rejected: 1-invalid bug
                                                                                      2-duplicated


6. Test Closure: for 1 US = 1 or more TC -> 1 test execution -> pass/fail
                    DOD criteria: if all the possible test cases created? 1TC - 1 AC
                                  if each AC is tested or not?
                                  if any test case tested by manually, automatically or both?
                                  manual-> test case ticket on jira is created + test execution +
                                  ticket is created + test status (fail / pass)
                                  if there is a bug, what is the bug status?

                    Sprint level: Jira Xray
                    Old version -> test closure report -> RTM (traceability matrix)
                    ex: sprint23--> 12 user stories
                                    how many TC?
                                    12 Test execution -> test status
                                    how many bug reports?

======================================================

Jira Intro:
-project management app
    - docs: us, tc, bug, epic
    - tasks:  ex: install intellij, create framework (extra things other than test activities)
    - communication: by comments
    - reports created (burn-down charts, sprint report, release report)
    - doc/task tracking: especially bugs, us etc.
    - link issues and keep track

jira -> story, bug, test, test execution, epic, etc. --> ticket, issue

2001 -> initial release
        plugin: extra features
        jira - zephyr plugin:  30 reports, story, bug, etc. (basic module)
        jira - xray plugin: 100+ reports, story, bug, test, test execution, epic, etc. (advance module)
